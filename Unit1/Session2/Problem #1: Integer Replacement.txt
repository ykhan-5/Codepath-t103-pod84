Given a positive integer n, you can apply one of the following operations:

If n is even, replace n with n / 2.
If n is odd, replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.
Return the minimum number of operations needed for n to become 1.
Tip: Java programmers should treat Integer.MAX_VALUE() as a special case.


Example 1:
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

Example 2:
Input: n = 7
Output: 4
Explanation: 7 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
or 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

Example 3:
Input: n = 4
Output: 2


Understand
1 -> +inf
base case - 1
input 1 -> 0


Match
recursion + memoization (probably have same problems)

Plan
If n is even, replace n with n / 2.
If n is odd, replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1. (replace based on minimum number)

Implement
memoization
recursion
base case implementation
